1.) The script would run in the implementation phase of the SDLC.
2.) They would be valuable when you have to run the test multiple times, they can be reused.
3.) They would hook into CID in CI/CD using step definitions.
4.) I would use Jenkins for CI/CD.
5.) They would be effective in dev in environment
6.) You can run all tests in dev enviroment that not ready to deployed to stage ready for production enviroment
7.) I would use Jenkins and the frequency of build is configurable.
8.) Any IDE should work here example pycham, cucumber
9.) I would use loadrunner, Jmeter for performance testing and cucumber for regression tests.
